BODY PART:
Abs, Back


Step 1
Starting Position: Lie prone (on your stomach) on an exercise mat or floor with your elbows close to your sides and directly under your shoulders, palms down and hands facing forward. 
Contract your quadriceps to extend your legs and dorsiflex your ankles (pull toes towards your shins). 
Contract your core and abdominal muscles to stiffen your torso.

Step 2
Upward Phase. Slowly lift your entire torso off the floor or mat, maintaining a stiff torso and legs. 
Avoid any arching (sagging) in your low back, hiking (upwards) in your hips or bending in the knees. 
Avoid shrugging your shoulder and keep your shoulders positioned directly over your elbows with your palms facing down. 
Continue to breath while holding this position for a specified time (5+ seconds).

Step 3
Downward Phase: While maintaining a stiff torso and extended knees, gently lower your body back towards the mat or floor before relaxing.
If you experience any pain in the low back with this movement, stop the exercise immediately and consult with your doctor.
