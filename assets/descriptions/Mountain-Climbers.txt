Step 1
Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor, positioning your knees and feet hip-width apart, with your feet dorsi-flexed (toes pointing towards your body). 
Slowly lean forward to place your hands on the floor slightly in front of your shoulders, fingers pointing forwards.  Flex your left hip, bringing your left thigh to your chest, placing your left foot on the floor, heel slighlty lifted and toes pointing forward.  
Lift your right knee off the ground, fully extending your right leg behind you, with your foot in dorsi flexion, (toes pointing towards your shins, heel up).  
Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back)

Step 2
Keeping your hands firmly on the ground, abs engaged and shoulder strong, simultaneously switch leg positions.  
Both feet leave the ground as your drive your right knee forward and extend your left leg back.  
Now your left leg is fully extending behind you and your right hip is flexed with your right foot on the floor.
 
Step 3
Exercise Variation: If you have limited range of motion in the hips, place hands on a step or platform.
Keep your weight evenly distributed on both legs. Do not shift all your weight foward into your front foot.
