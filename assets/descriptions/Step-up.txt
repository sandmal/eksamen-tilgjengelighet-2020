BODY PART:
Butt/Hips, Legs - Thighs


Step 1
Starting Position: Stand with your feet parallel about hip width apart while holding dumbbells in your hands with palms facing inwards. 
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back).
Attempt to avoid shrugging your shoulder upwards.

Step 2
Upward Phase: Slowly step to place your right foot on a platform, placing your foot firmly on the deck while keeping your torso upright and aligning your knee over your second toe. 
Push off with the trailing (left) leg to raise your body onto the platform placing that foot alongside your leading (right) foot. 
During this transition, your torso and your right tibia (shinbone) will move slightly forward past vertical, but try to avoid excessive forward movement.

Step 3
Downward Phase: Slowly load the weight of your body into your leading (right) foot, step backwards to place the trailing (left) foot on the floor in its starting position. 
Allow your body to lean slightly forward during the step-down movement. Load your weight into your trailing (left) foot and step off the platform with your leading (right) foot, returning to your starting position. 
Repeat for the opposite side.

Step 4
An exercise progression is to step-up onto one leg only and remain standing on a single-leg before stepping back down.
Single-leg stepping is a functional movement we perform daily. 
Always monitor your foot, ankle and knee position. 
Avoid movement of your foot and ankle (collapsing in or out), and always attempt to keep your knee aligned over your second toe.
