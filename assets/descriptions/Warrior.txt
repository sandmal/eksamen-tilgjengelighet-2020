Step 1
Starting Position:  Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward and arms by your sides. 
Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Inhale.

Step 2
Exhale and take a larger step forward with your right foot while raising your arms to the ceiling, palms facing each other. 
Keep your right foot pointed forward and turn your left foot out to the side 45 to 60 degrees. Align your left heel with your right.  
Begin lunging forward into the right leg while keeping your back (left) leg extended.  
Do not allow the right knee to extend past the right toes. 
Keep the back (left) heel in contact with the ground. 
Slowly drop your hips and rotate your torso to the right squaring your shoulders and hips to the front of the matt. 
Support your weight by pushing through your left foot and reach through your arms up lifting your ribcage away from the pelvis. 

Step 3
Hold this position for 3-5 slow, deep breaths (approximately 20-30 seconds) and repeat on the other side.
